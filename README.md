Learning to code is hard.
We know, but why?


There's been many times I've tried to teach myself to code and then hit a wall and gave up. You go for a while thinking you're really getting it, and you're ready to go out and create something awesome. So you sit down at your computer with an idea in mind, open your text editor, and just stare at the screen.

Where the hell do I even begin?

Thats something I hear all the time from people starting out and learning, and it's something we can all relate to. What happened to everything I just learned? How do I apply it? Where to I keep the files? Or maybe you understand that much and you even know what you need to do; you just don't know how to get there. What is the step i'm missing? I've heard of this framework and I know I need it to get to where I need to be, but I have no idea where to begin.

In comes documentation

Developers live in the docs. It's supposed to be a land of no secrets and the key to understanding how to use that specific technology. Great! I guess if I have to learn this new puzzle piece I'll go check out the docs and come back with an understanding and be able to put it to practical use! So you start reading, and sooner rather than later you just get angry and frustrated because these people are explaining already foreign concepts with even more foreign terminology on a very technical level. So what do you do? I know I've just given up and walked away multiple times, finally accepting developers are just not muggles like the rest of us and I better not question how they do things because it's literally rocket science to me. The above process repeated about 15 times for me until I finally decided to go to school and actually give it a real shot. Mostly because it had been so long that I had forgotten all the complete bullshit that was about to hit me right in the face. But this time it didn't. Well, I shouldn't say it didn't. It came to me easier than it had before. I didn't know why, I was just happy it was working. Fast forward to the first major project. I'm pumped. I feel like a super hero. I understand this stuff. I know how to actually do things now. Then I sit down to start.

What. The. Fuck.

There's that wall again! Except now I don't have to feed my computer to my dog, I have teachers who know this that can actually help! Right? Yes. And no. But yes. But also no.

Breaking it down

I don't care what you're studying in school, it's just a fact that you cannot just rely on what the teachers give you to really drill the knowledge into your head. Teachers can be an invaluable resource, but most often they've been doing this for a long time and understand these concepts very well at a core level. So when you ask a teacher something you're essentially asking those docs you know and love. Function this method that pass this data allocate that memory discover the cure for cancer blah blah blah.

STOP
That wont help. It sucks to realize, but it won't. So then you're out to lunch with a classmate explaining how much something just doesn't make sense, and they say 'Oh that's easy! Just think of it like this ---'

Ohhhhhhhhh, I get it now

That's the secret to learning something. How can I think of it so that, with my limited knowledge as a whole, it makes sense to me?

That's where we come in.
When you're learning you generally are taking notes to refer back to, because no one can remember everything. You get to a point where you say 'Okay I know what I need to do, but I don't remember how'. So you start digging through old projects and ratty binders till you find what you're looking for so you can get the stuff you're looking for. How you explained it to yourself as a dumbed down five year old, and what you did in your code to hook it up and make it work. We want to enable you to take your awesome journey into code online and document the whole experience. So when you finally get that job and have to deal with a recursive method you don't have a heart attack. You just go back to when you learned it and read about it in it's most simple and understandable form. Or maybe you forgot to take notes on something. Ruh Roh. It's okay, because at some point some one else learned it and they had to break it down for themselves, so you could just go read their simplified interpretation from when they we're still learning it. It's like you can store your Ah-hah! moments online and never worry about forgetting how something works again.

So that's our mission. Hope you're on board. Or not. We are, so it'll still be here.

#Project Operating Agreement

##Stand-ups
Come prepared.
* What did you do?
* What do you want to do next?
* What are you struggling with?
* Did you discover any useful tips to share?
* What is your pairing preference?

Everyone answers these questions and then the floor is open for conversation. Let them get out everything.

Morning - 8:15 AM
Morning(non-technical) - 10:15 AM
Afternoon - 12:45 PM
Evening - 4:30 PM

Lunch is still 11:30-1:00. Feel free to keep coding, but you probably shouldn't be.

8:00 check in if the guys are still here.

##Workflow
* Don't push broken code to master.
* Every pull request must have at least one feature test.
* Fork or branch, just keep it tidy people.
* Kanban whiteboard. High-five yourself and team. Confidence is contagious.
* Pair more often while working with new tech.
* Pair less often while confident it will accelerate progress.

##Group Dynamics
* Encourage lunch together as well as snack trips.
* If you feel like you need to take the night off and come fresh tomorrow, do it.
* If you're stuck for more than 20 minutes, ask a group memeber for help.
* Still stuck? Address blocker at standup, make progress somewhere else.
* We are always pseudo pairing, everyone is here to help each other.

##MVP IS EVERYTHING
####How do we get there?
* Icebox aggressively. Post it and drop it.
* Make sure everyone shares same explicit vision.
* Don't chase sunk cost.
* Limit new tech.


##Responsibilities
Nathan - Project Manager
  Always knows what people are doing
  Knows what's next for the project

Christian - Database/Server/Partial Speacialist

Jim - User Experience

Brang - Brang

## Conflict Resolution
* Objective - Explain your thinking (pros/cons) such that group can agree on best course (consensus).
* Rate from 1-10 your level of concern
* Timebox to 30 minutes with vote resolution. Clock stops if a break is neaded to collect oneself.
* If vote is deadlocked, seek arbitration from Lucas/Casey/Leon/Alex
